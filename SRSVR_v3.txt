## Electric Car Management Mobile Application - SRS Validation Report

**Date:** October 29, 2023

**Prepared By:** AI Audit Assistant

**1. Executive Summary:**

This report presents a validation of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for the Electric Car Management Mobile Application (ECM App) against the User Requirements Document (URD) and the IEEE 830-1998 standard. The SRS demonstrates good overall structure and content, addressing many of the URD requirements and adhering to the IEEE 830-1998 recommended practice. However, several areas require improvement, including addressing all URD requirements, enhancing requirement clarity, completing missing information (TBDs), refining verification methods, and improving traceability.

**2. Detailed Analysis by Section:**

**2.1. Revision History:**

*   **Finding:** Adequate revision history tracking.
*   **Status:** Compliant

**2.2. 1. Introduction:**

*   **1.1 Purpose:** Adequate purpose statement and intended audience.
*   **1.2 Scope:** Clearly defines what the application will and will not do.  The exclusion of "Detailed database schema design", "Specific UI/UX designs (wireframes)", "Implementation-specific code details", "Backend server infrastructure setup" and "Detailed security threat model and risk assessment" is reasonable for an SRS.
*   **1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations:** Comprehensive list.
*   **1.4 References:** Good referencing, including standards and the URD.
*   **1.5 Overview:** Describes the organization of the SRS.
*   **Status:** Compliant

**2.3. 2. Overall Description:**

*   **2.1 Product Perspective:** Adequately describes system interfaces, user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software interfaces, and communication interfaces.
*   **2.2 Product Functions:**  Prioritizes functions appropriately. Includes user confirmation for critical operations which is good.
*   **2.3 User Characteristics:** Describes user characteristics.
*   **2.4 Constraints:** Covers regulatory policies, hardware limitations, API availability, security, offline functionality, and response time.
*   **2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies:** Lists assumptions and dependencies.
*   **Status:** Compliant

**2.4. 3. Specific Requirements:**

*   **3.1 External Interface Requirements:**
    *   **API Interface:** Well-defined API requirements with versioning and error handling.
    *   **User Interface:** Describes responsive UI, dark/light mode, and accessibility. Includes WCAG conformance which is good.
    *   **Mapping Interface:** Integration with mapping services described.
    *   **Notification Interface:** Specifies push notifications and user preferences.
*   **3.2 Functional Requirements:**
    *   **Vehicle Monitoring:** Addresses battery level, charging status, location tracking, route history, and energy consumption. Requires real-time definition which is good. Defines verification tests.
    *   **Charging Management:** Describes charging station location, scheduling, notifications, and cost tracking. Includes definition of "nearby" charging stations which is good. Defines verification tests.
    *   **Vehicle Control:** Allows remote start/stop charging, pre-conditioning, lock/unlock, and horn/lights activation. Requires user confirmation for charging. Defines verification tests.
    *   **Trip Planning:** Includes route planning with charging stops, energy calculation, favorite locations, and weather adjustments. Verification method is weak (comparison with commercial product).  It should, at minimum, include *how* it's being compared with other products (e.g. distance, charging, stops, route)
    *   **Maintenance & Diagnostics:** Covers maintenance reminders, diagnostic information, service scheduling, and maintenance history. Defines verification tests.
    *   **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling is specified and verified
    *   **Authorization:** Permission levels of administrator, driver and guest are appropriately defined
*   **3.3 Performance Requirements:** Specifies response time, battery consumption, and peak load handling.
*   **3.4 Design Constraints:** Specifies platform-native technologies, UI/UX guidelines, encryption, authentication, and authorization levels.
*   **3.5 Software System Attributes:** Addresses reliability, availability, security, maintainability, and portability. Defines how attributes will be measured.
*   **Status:** Mostly Compliant with noted improvement areas.

**3. List of Missing Requirements (from URD):**

*   **None:** All URD requirements appear to be addressed to some extent in the SRS. However, the level of detail in several areas needs improvement (e.g., trip planning verification).

**4. Compliance Gaps with IEEE 830-1998:**

*   **Traceability:** While requirement IDs are present, explicit backward traceability to the URD is not documented within each requirement. A table mapping URD requirements to SRS requirements would enhance traceability.
*   **Prioritization/Stability:** While stability ranking is mentioned, the rationale behind the assigned stability levels isn't always clear.  Adding why a particular requirement is expected to be volatile, stable, or expected to change would be useful.
*   **Testability/Verifiability:** While many functional requirements include verification methods, some methods lack sufficient detail to be effectively implemented. TP-1.0 (Trip Planning) specifically lacks the level of detail. It says compare with a "commercially available trip planning app" but provides no comparison criteria.

**5. Specific Recommendations for Improvement:**

*   **Traceability Matrix:** Create a traceability matrix linking each SRS requirement to its corresponding user requirement in the URD.
*   **Requirement Detail:** Enhance the detail and clarity of verification methods, ensuring they are specific and measurable. For instance, specify the tolerances/acceptable ranges for comparison-based verifications. Ensure data can be validated, such as validating that the trip planning algorithm in TP-1.1 considers weather and other external factors.
*   **Trip Planning Algorithm Details:** Expand on weather conditions, and external factors, and also the calculations being done in the trip planning functionality TP-1.1 for accuracy.
*   **Rationale for Stability:** Justify the assigned stability levels for each requirement, providing context for potential future changes.
*   **Functional Grouping:** Provide the definition on how requirements are functional grouped, where the groups are defined in 3.2
*   **Site/Maintenance Acceptance**: Expand upon how this maintenance will be performed.
*   **Define Notification Delivery** Expand on push notifications and how they are sent using FCM and APNs.

**6. Problems Identified:**

*  **Problem 1:** Missing explicit backward traceability matrix to the URD.
*  **Problem 2:** Inadequate verification method for Trip Planning functionality (TP-1.0) (unmeasurable - unclear).
*  **Problem 3:** Lack of specific details describing trip planning calculations.
