## SRS Validation Report - Electric Car Management Mobile Application

**Date:** October 28, 2023

**Validator:** AI Assistant

**1. Executive Summary:**

This report presents a validation of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Electric Car Management Mobile Application against the provided User Requirements Document (URD) and the IEEE 830-1998 standard.  The SRS generally adheres to the IEEE 830-1998 standard in terms of structure and content. Most of the user requirements specified in the URD are addressed within the SRS, although there are some areas where improvements are recommended to enhance completeness, clarity, and testability. Several instances of ambiguities, missing details, and inconsistencies were identified. The inclusion of the sample data is useful to improve the quality of the document. The compliance check with 12207 is useful to comply with standards. Additional details related to standards and metrics are required to pass the audit.

**2. Detailed Analysis by Section:**

**2.1. Introduction (Section 1):**

*   **1.4 References:** Includes relevant references, including the URD and IEEE 830-1998.
*   **1.5 Overview:** Succinctly describes the organization of the SRS.
*   **Overall Assessment:** Section 1 is well-structured and compliant with IEEE 830-1998.

**2.2. Overall Description (Section 2):**

*   **2.1 Product Perspective:** Thoroughly describes system interfaces (API, UI, Hardware, Software, Communication).
*   **2.2 Product Functions:**  Lists major functions with prioritization.
*   **2.3 User Characteristics:** Defines user characteristics with varying levels of technical expertise.
*   **2.4 Constraints:** Addresses regulatory policies, hardware limitations, API availability, security, offline functionality, response time, and mobile OS versions. Details could be expanded.
*   **2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies:**  Identifies assumptions and dependencies related to the API, user accounts, connectivity, GPS, and mapping/charging data.
*   **Overall Assessment:** Section 2 provides a good overview of the product and its context.

**2.3. Specific Requirements (Section 3):**

*   **3.1 External Interface Requirements:**
    *   API Interface: Well-defined, but lacks specifics on API versioning support besides the manufacturer's API.
    *   User Interface: General requirements are defined.
    *   Mapping Interface: Adequate.
    *   Notification Interface: Adequate.
*   **3.2 Functional Requirements:**
    *   Vehicle Monitoring: Well-defined requirements with verification methods.
    *   Charging Management:  Clear requirements with verification methods.
    *   Vehicle Control: User confirmation requirement for remote start/stop is good.
    *   Trip Planning: Clear requirements with verification methods.
    *   Maintenance & Diagnostics: Requirements are clear, and verification methods are defined.
    *   Error Handling: User-friendly error messages are important.
*   **3.3 Performance Requirements:**
    *   Response time, battery consumption, load handling are well defined.
*   **3.4 Design Constraints:**
    *   Platform native technologies, UI/UX guidelines, data encryption, authentication, authorization levels, backend data compliance are covered.
*   **3.5 Software System Attributes:**
    *   Reliability, Availability, Security, Maintainability, Portability are addressed. Specific metrics or targets for maintainability and portability are missing.
*   **3.6 Data Requirements:**
    *   Data storage, privacy, and regulatory compliance are stated.

**2.4 Supporting Information (Section 4):**

*   **4.1 Appendix A: Data Dictionary:** Helpful, but could be expanded with more data elements relevant to trip planning, maintenance, and vehicle control.
*   **4.2 Appendix B: Sample Input/Output Formats:** Very useful for developers. More comprehensive examples could be beneficial.
*   **4.3 Index:** Comprehensive.
*   **Overall Assessment:** The supporting information is valuable but could be enhanced.

**3. List of Missing Requirements:**

*   **URD - Trip Planning:** Weather-based range adjustments are mentioned in the URD. This is addressed in TP-1.3, but the verification method is too vague ("Compare the estimated range with actual range achieved in similar weather conditions by reviewing the driving history"). A more concrete verification method is needed, potentially involving specific weather conditions and expected range deviations.
*   **URD - Security & Privacy:** Vehicle access should have multiple authorization levels (e.g., owner, driver, guest). This is addressed in DC-1.4. However, the SRS lacks specific functional requirements outlining the different permissions and capabilities associated with each authorization level.

**4. Compliance Gaps with IEEE 830-1998:**

*   **4.3.5 Ranked for importance and/or stability:** While priorities (High, Medium, Low) are assigned, a stability ranking as recommended by IEEE 830-1998 (Section 4.3.5.1) is not explicitly included for each requirement. A stability ranking (e.g., "Stable," "Expected to Change," "Volatile") would provide additional context for development and maintenance.
*   **4.3.6 Verifiable:** Several verification steps are inadequate. For example, *Verify that the application can integrate with a service scheduling system or provide contact information for scheduling appointments. This verification confirms integration to a service system.* This must be expanded to detail integration processes and standards being used.

**5. Specific Recommendations for Improvement:**

*   **Expand Verification Methods:** Refine verification methods to be more concrete and measurable.  Avoid vague statements like "compare with commercially available app" or "review driving history." Provide specific data points, tools, and acceptance criteria.
*   **Clarify Authorization Levels:**  Provide more detail on the functional differences between vehicle authorization levels (owner, driver, guest).  Define the specific actions each level can perform.
*   **Implement Stability Ranking:** Add a stability ranking to each requirement to indicate its likelihood of changing.
*   **Enhance Design Constraints:** Elaborate on design constraints, particularly those related to data privacy and security. Specify encryption algorithms, key management procedures, and compliance standards.
*   **Provide More Comprehensive Examples:**  Expand the sample input/output formats to include more complex scenarios and error conditions.
*   **Add Detailed Error Handling:** Although error handling is mentioned, specify more error handling and testing requirements.
*   **Include Integration Testing Standards**: Integration verification needs to have the integration standards, tests and tools that are going to be used during testing processes.
*   **Document Performance Metrics**: Document performance metrics that were used during system implementation. This shows that metrics are considered.

**6. Identified Problems (Detailed):**

1.  **Missing Detail - Authorization Levels:** Lack of specific functional requirements outlining the permissions and capabilities associated with each authorization level (owner, driver, guest). (Missing Requirement)
2.  **Vague Verification - Weather-Based Range Adjustment:**  Verification method for TP-1.3 is not concrete enough. (Verifiability)
3.  **Missing Stability Ranking:** Absence of a stability ranking for requirements. (IEEE 830-1998 Compliance)
4.  **Non-Specific Verification - Service Scheduling Integration**: Refers to "integrating with a service scheduling system", but the verification steps are vague and not measurable. (Verifiability)
5.  **Inadequate Design Constraint Detail**: While encryption is mentioned in DC-1.2, the specific key management and data security design are not documented.
6.  **Incomplete Error Handling:** While EH requirements are noted, additional error states should be included that would be part of testing implementation.
7.  **Lack of Testing Detail**: Specific integration and functional test processes and standards are missing to describe what is necessary to conduct tests.
