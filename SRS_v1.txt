**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**

The ECM App will be a mobile application that interacts with the electric vehicle through a secure API provided by the vehicle manufacturer's backend system. The app will be a component of a larger ecosystem, integrating with the vehicle's onboard systems, charging station networks, and potentially other services (e.g., mapping/navigation apps).
The ECM App does not directly interact with the electric vehicle's hardware. All communication is via manufacturer API.

*   **System Interfaces:** The app will interact with the vehicle manufacturer's API (RESTful interface).
*   **User Interfaces:** Intuitive mobile UI, with dark/light mode options. Supports both iOS and Android.
*   **Hardware Interfaces:** Mobile devices running iOS or Android with network connectivity (cellular/Wi-Fi) and GPS capabilities.
*   **Software Interfaces:** Integrates with mapping applications (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps) and charging network APIs.
*   **Communication Interfaces:**  HTTP/HTTPS for API communication, GPS for location tracking, Push Notifications for alerts.

**2.2 Product Functions**

The ECM App will provide the following major functions:

*   **Vehicle Monitoring:** Displays real-time battery level, charging status, location, energy consumption metrics, and route history.
*   **Charging Management:** Locates nearby charging stations, schedules charging sessions, sets charging limits, and tracks charging costs/history.
*   **Vehicle Control:** Remotely starts/stops charging, pre-conditions cabin temperature, locks/unlocks vehicle, and activates horn/lights.
*   **Trip Planning:** Plans routes with charging stops, calculates trip energy requirements, and saves favorite locations/routes. Adjusts range based on weather conditions.
*   **Maintenance & Diagnostics:** Displays maintenance reminders/alerts, accesses vehicle diagnostic information, schedules service appointments, and tracks maintenance history/costs.

**2.3 User Characteristics**

The primary users of the ECM App are car engineering team members, typically with varying degrees of technical expertise. The application should be intuitive to use for both technical and non-technical users.

*   **Education Level:** High school diploma or equivalent (minimum).
*   **Experience:** Ranging from novice mobile app users to experienced automotive engineers.
*   **Technical Expertise:** Varies significantly across user groups. The UI/UX should be designed to cater to the least technically savvy user while providing advanced features for experienced users.

*   **Constraints:** Technical, environmental, and design constraints are clearly defined.
*   **Requirement IDs & Priorities:** Each requirement has a unique ID (e.g., VM-1.0, CM-1.1) and priority level (High, Medium, Low).
*   **Traceability:** While full traceability matrices would be built separately, the requirement IDs provide the base for traceability between user needs and software requirements. The "Verification" clauses also provide some sense of forward traceability to testing efforts.
*   **Definitions:** Includes a section dedicated to definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations.
*   **Verification Clauses:** Crucially, each requirement now has a  `Verification` section describing *how* the requirement can be verified (usually via testing).

*   **Traceability Matrix:** Create a detailed traceability matrix to map user requirements from the URD to specific software requirements in the SRS.
*   **UI/UX Design:**  Create wireframes and mockups of the UI to further clarify user interface requirements.
*   **Review:** Have the SRS reviewed by all stakeholders (developers, testers, project managers, customer representatives) to ensure it is complete, accurate, and unambiguous.
*   **Refinement:**  Iterate on the SRS based on feedback from the review process.
*   **Configuration Management:** Place the SRS under configuration management control.
