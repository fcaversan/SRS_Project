PROMPT:
Let's generate a document with user requirements for a mobile application that will be an electric car management app. Pretend you are the user describing what you want for the app. You're not a technical user, you are part of the car engineering team so you do have a deep understanding of the car itself.

RESPONSE:
Okay, so here's what I'm envisioning for this Electric Car Management App. We need something that's actually *useful* for our customers, and more importantly, reliable. No glitches, no freezes – just solid performance that gives them real-time information and control. I'm thinking of this from the perspective of someone who's spent years working on the car's systems, so I know what information is actually important.

**Overall Goal:**

The app should be the primary interface for the user to monitor and manage their electric vehicle (EV). It needs to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing them with essential information about the car's status, charging, and performance.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

1.  **Vehicle Status Monitoring:**

    *   **Battery Level:** Obviously, this is crucial. I want a clear and prominent display of the current battery percentage. We need to make sure it's accurate and updates frequently. Should also show the voltage and the current going in/out of the battery pack. Users need to be able to trust this, otherwise, range anxiety will kick in.
    *   **Estimated Range:** Based on the current battery level, driving habits (stored in the cloud, of course), weather conditions (fetch this from a reliable weather API), and selected driving mode (e.g., Eco, Sport). I want this to be more accurate than the dash display.
    *   **Temperature:** Critical for battery health. Show the battery pack temperature and outside temperature. Alert the user if the battery temperature is dangerously high or low.
    *   **Tire Pressure:** Display individual tire pressures. Alert the user if any tire is significantly under- or over-inflated. This is crucial for safety and efficiency. We need to use the existing sensor data.
    *   **Vehicle Location:** Track the car's location in real-time using GPS. This is good for security and also helps the user remember where they parked.
    *   **Vehicle Health Diagnostics:** Basic health check. Can we expose some of the error codes the onboard computer is generating? Nothing too technical, but maybe categorize them as "Minor Issues," "Medium Issues," and "Critical Issues." If it's critical, they need to call support immediately.
    *   **Alerts and Notifications:** Push notifications for low battery, charging complete, tire pressure alerts, overheating warnings, and any other critical issue. Should be configurable to avoid annoying the user.

2.  **Charging Management:**

    *   **Charging Status:** When charging, show the charging rate (kW), current battery level, estimated time to full charge, and total energy delivered so far.
    *   **Charging History:** Keep a log of all past charging sessions, including date, time, duration, energy delivered, and cost (if the user inputs their electricity rate).
    *   **Scheduled Charging:** Allow the user to schedule charging to take advantage of off-peak electricity rates. They should be able to set start and end times. This needs to be rock solid; they don't want to wake up to an uncharged car.
    *   **Charge Limit:** Allow the user to set a charge limit (e.g., 80%) to prolong battery life. This should override the default charging behavior.
    *   **Locate Charging Stations:** Integrate a map showing nearby public charging stations, including availability (how many are in use), charging speed (kW), and pricing (if available). Use a reliable charging station API that's updated frequently.

3.  **Vehicle Control (with proper security measures):**

    *   **Remote Start/Stop Charging:** Allow the user to remotely start and stop charging. Security is paramount here. Two-factor authentication is a must.
    *   **Climate Control Preconditioning:** Remotely turn on the climate control system to pre-heat or pre-cool the cabin before driving. This should be able to use the charging system's energy if available, or the battery if not.
    *   **Lock/Unlock Doors:** Remotely lock and unlock the doors. Again, security is critical.
    *   **Frunk/Trunk Release:** Remotely open the frunk or trunk. Useful if someone needs to drop something off.
    *   **Honk/Flash Lights:** Remotely honk the horn and/or flash the headlights to help locate the car in a parking lot.

4.  **Performance Data:**

    *   **Trip History:** Record trip details, including date, time, distance, average speed, energy consumption (kWh/mile), and route.
    *   **Driving Efficiency:** Display a graph of the user's driving efficiency over time, showing kWh/mile. Offer tips to improve efficiency.
    *   **Regenerative Braking Statistics:** Show how much energy the user has recovered through regenerative braking. Gamify it a little to encourage efficient driving!
    *   **Maintenance Reminders:** Generate reminders for scheduled maintenance based on mileage or time.

5.  **User Profile and Customization:**

    *   **Vehicle Information:** Store vehicle information, such as VIN, model year, and trim level.
    *   **Driving Profiles:** Allow users to create and save driving profiles (e.g., "Commute," "Road Trip") with customized settings for acceleration, regenerative braking, and climate control.
    *   **Notification Preferences:** Allow users to customize which notifications they receive and how they are delivered.
    *   **Theme Customization:** Allow users to choose between light and dark themes.

**Technical Requirements:**

*   **Secure Authentication:** Robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. We can't emphasize this enough.
*   **Data Encryption:** All data transmitted between the app and the vehicle must be encrypted.
*   **API Integration:** Seamless integration with the vehicle's onboard systems via a secure API. We control the API so we have to build a great one.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** A scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure to handle data storage, processing, and distribution.
*   **Platform Compatibility:** Native apps for iOS and Android.
*   **Offline Functionality:** Allow users to access basic information (e.g., last known battery level) even when they are not connected to the internet.
*   **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:** Ability to update the app remotely to add new features and fix bugs.
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities.

**Design Considerations:**

*   **Clean and Intuitive Interface:** Easy to navigate and understand, even for users who are not tech-savvy.
*   **Visually Appealing:** Modern and aesthetically pleasing design that reflects the brand image.
*   **Consistent User Experience:** Consistent design language across all platforms (iOS and Android).
*   **Focus on Essential Information:** Prioritize the display of the most important information. Avoid clutter.

**Testing:**

*   **Rigorous testing:** Before launch we need many different users, with different cars, in different states to be testing the app.
*   **Beta program:** Run a beta program with real users to gather feedback and identify bugs.
*   **Continuous monitoring:** Continuously monitor app performance and user feedback after launch to identify and address any issues.

**Things I *Don't* Want:**

*   **Bloatware:** No unnecessary features that clutter the interface and slow down performance.
*   **Excessive Permissions:** Only request the permissions that are absolutely necessary.
*   **Constant Notifications:** Avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary notifications.
*   **Unreliable Data:** The data displayed in the app must be accurate and reliable. False information is worse than no information.

This is a starting point. The goal is to build an app that makes owning an electric car easier and more enjoyable. Let's make this the best EV management app out there!
