**1.5 Overview**

The remainder of this SRS document provides a detailed description of the ECM App, including the overall product perspective, product functions, user characteristics, constraints, assumptions, and specific requirements. Section 2 provides a general overview of the application. Section 3 provides functional, non-functional, and interface requirements in detail. Appendix A provides a traceability matrix linking SRS requirements to the URD.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**

The ECM App will be a mobile application that interacts with the electric vehicle through a secure API provided by the vehicle manufacturer's backend system. The app will be a component of a larger ecosystem, integrating with the vehicle's onboard systems, charging station networks, and potentially other services (e.g., mapping/navigation apps).

The ECM App does not directly interact with the electric vehicle's hardware. All communication is via manufacturer API.

*   **System Interfaces:**
    *   The app will interact with the vehicle manufacturer's API (RESTful interface).
    *   The API will expose endpoints for retrieving vehicle status (SOC, location, charging status), controlling vehicle functions (locking/unlocking, starting/stopping charging, pre-conditioning), and accessing maintenance/diagnostic information.
    *   Data will be exchanged using JSON format.
    *   Authentication will be via OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. Refresh tokens will be used to maintain session state.
    *   The API will support versioning using semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). The app will initially support version 1.0, and will implement a mechanism to notify the user when a new version of the API is available, prompting them to update the app if necessary. Backward compatibility will be maintained where possible.
*   **User Interfaces:**
    *   Intuitive mobile UI, with dark/light mode options.
    *   Supports both iOS and Android.
    *   The UI will adhere to platform-specific guidelines (Apple Human Interface Guidelines, Android Material Design).
    *   The UI will also support localization for English and Spanish (initially). All text elements will be stored in resource files to facilitate localization, and bidirectional UI support will be implemented using platform-specific APIs (e.g., `NSLayoutConstraint` in iOS, `RelativeLayout` in Android).
    *   Accessibility will be designed based on WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
*   **Hardware Interfaces:**
    *   Mobile devices running iOS or Android with network connectivity (cellular/Wi-Fi) and GPS capabilities.
    *   The app will be tested on a range of devices with varying CPU, memory, and screen sizes (see Appendix D for the device test matrix).
*   **Software Interfaces:**
    *   Integrates with mapping applications (e.g., Google Maps API, Apple Maps API) and charging network APIs (e.g., Electrify America, ChargePoint).
    *   The charging network APIs will be used to retrieve charging station availability and pricing information. The app will use a standardized interface (e.g., OCPP – Open Charge Point Protocol) where available, to ensure compatibility with a wider range of charging networks.
*   **Communication Interfaces:**
    *   HTTP/HTTPS for API communication (TLS 1.3 or higher).
    *   GPS for location tracking.
    *   Push Notifications (using FCM for Android and APNs for iOS) for alerts. Push notifications will be encrypted end-to-end to protect sensitive information.

**2.2 Product Functions**

The ECM App will provide the following major functions, prioritized from highest to lowest. *Functional groups are defined by the primary functionality they provide to the user*:

1.  **Vehicle Monitoring:** Displays real-time battery level, charging status, location, energy consumption metrics, and route history. This functional group includes features to display SOC (VM-1.0), charging status (VM-1.1), vehicle location (VM-1.2), route history (VM-1.3) and energy consumption metrics (VM-1.4).
2.  **Charging Management:** Locates nearby charging stations, schedules charging sessions, sets charging limits, and tracks charging costs/history. This functional group includes features to locate charging stations (CM-1.0), scheduling sessions (CM-1.1), providing notifications (CM-1.2) and tracking cost (CM-1.3).
3.  **Vehicle Control:** Remotely starts/stops charging, pre-conditions cabin temperature, locks/unlocks vehicle, and activates horn/lights. *User confirmation will be required for critical operations like remotely starting/stopping charging.* This functional group provides ability for the users to start and stop charging remotely (VC-1.0), pre-condition the cabin remotely (VC-1.1), lock and unlock the vehicle remotely (VC-1.2) and activate the horn and lights remotely (VC-1.3).
4.  **Trip Planning:** Plans routes with charging stops, calculates trip energy requirements, and saves favorite locations/routes. Adjusts range based on weather conditions. This functional group provides an ability to plan a route including charging stops (TP-1.0), estimate trip energy requirements (TP-1.1), save favorite locations and routes (TP-1.2) and adjust the range estimations based on the weather conditions (TP-1.3).
5.  **Maintenance & Diagnostics:** Displays maintenance reminders/alerts, accesses vehicle diagnostic information, schedules service appointments, and tracks maintenance history/costs. This functional group provides an ability to get maintenance reminders and alerts (MD-1.0), access vehicle diagnostic information (MD-1.1), schedule service appointments (MD-1.2) and track maintenance history (MD-1.3).

**2.3 User Characteristics**

The primary users of the ECM App are car engineering team members, typically with varying degrees of technical expertise. The application should be intuitive to use for both technical and non-technical users.

*   **Technical Users:** Users with experience in software development, automotive engineering, or related technical fields, who are familiar with technical concepts and terminology. These users are comfortable with complex interfaces and advanced settings.
*   **Non-Technical Users:** Users who lack specific technical knowledge or experience, and who are primarily interested in using the app for its core functionality without needing to understand the underlying technical details. These users prefer simple, intuitive interfaces with clear instructions.

*   **Education Level:** High school diploma or equivalent (minimum).
*   **Experience:** Ranging from novice mobile app users to experienced automotive engineers.  *Approximately 60% of users are expected to be familiar with mobile apps.*
*   **Technical Expertise:** Varies significantly across user groups. The UI/UX should be designed to cater to the least technically savvy user (40%) while providing advanced features for experienced users (60%). UI/UX guidelines will emphasize simplicity and ease of use. The UI will provide context-sensitive help and tutorials to assist users with less technical expertise.

**2.4 Constraints**

*   **Regulatory Policies:**
    *   Complies with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    *   *Specifically, the app will implement consent management for data collection and sharing, provide users with the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data, and comply with data localization requirements where applicable. Consent will be obtained through an explicit opt-in mechanism, and users will be able to revoke consent at any time.*
    *   Data will be retained only for as long as necessary and will be anonymized where possible.
    *   Data residency will be in accordance with EU regulations.
    *   **PCI DSS Compliance:** If payment information is processed, the app must adhere to PCI DSS 4.0 standards, including encrypting cardholder data at rest and in transit, implementing access controls, regularly monitoring and testing networks, and maintaining an information security policy.
*   **Hardware Limitations:**
    *   App must perform acceptably on a range of mobile devices (CPU, memory, screen size).
    *   *Acceptable performance is defined as a frame rate of at least 30 FPS and a memory footprint of less than 200MB on devices with at least 2GB of RAM.  Performance testing will be conducted on a representative set of devices (see Appendix D).*
*   **API Availability:**
    *   Functionality depends on the availability and reliability of the vehicle manufacturer's API.
    *   *The app will implement retry mechanisms and fallback strategies to handle API outages. A circuit breaker pattern will be implemented to prevent cascading failures. In the event of prolonged API outages, the app will display a clear error message to the user and provide information about the outage.*
*   **Security:**
    *   Vehicle control functions must be secured against unauthorized access.
    *   *The app will use TLS 1.3 or higher for secure communication, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) using TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) based on RFC 6238, and encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption. User confirmation will be required to complete the operation.*
    *   Key management will be performed using a secure key store provided by the operating system (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). Keys will be rotated regularly.
    *   The app will implement jailbreak/root detection to prevent running on compromised devices.
    *   The application will comply with OWASP Mobile Security Project guidelines.
*   **Offline Functionality:** Limited offline functionality is required (e.g., viewing saved locations/routes). The app should allow users to view cached charging station locations and previously saved routes even without an active internet connection. The offline cache will be updated whenever network connectivity is available.
*   **Response Time:** Critical operations (e.g., remote lock/unlock, start/stop charging) should have a response time under 3 seconds.
*   **Mobile OS Versions:** Supports Android 8.0 (Oreo) and above, and iOS 13 and above.
*   **Accessibility:** The application will adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. Automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., Accessibility Scanner for Android, Accessibility Inspector for iOS) and manual testing will be used to ensure conformance. The app must include alternative text for images, ensure sufficient color contrast, and provide adaptable text and UI elements to system font size settings.

**2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies**

*   The vehicle manufacturer will provide a stable and well-documented API for accessing vehicle data and control functions.
*   Users will have a valid account and authorized access to the electric vehicle.
*   Internet connectivity (cellular/Wi-Fi) will be available for most functions.
*   GPS functionality will be available on the user's mobile device.
*   Mapping data will be available through third-party mapping services (e.g., Google Maps API, Apple Maps API). *The app will use the free tier of these APIs initially, with the option to upgrade to a paid plan if usage exceeds the free tier limits.*
*   Charging station data will be available through public APIs from charging network providers (e.g. Electrify America, ChargePoint). The app will implement caching mechanisms to minimize API calls and improve performance. The caching mechanism will be implemented using a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy to prioritize frequently accessed data and minimize the number of API calls. The cache will be invalidated periodically (e.g., every 24 hours) and when the app detects changes in network connectivity or charging station data.
