**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**

The ECM App will be a mobile application that interacts with the electric vehicle through a secure API provided by the vehicle manufacturer's backend system. The app will be a component of a larger ecosystem, integrating with the vehicle's onboard systems, charging station networks, and potentially other services (e.g., mapping/navigation apps).

The ECM App does not directly interact with the electric vehicle's hardware. All communication is via manufacturer API.

*   **System Interfaces:**
    *   The app will interact with the vehicle manufacturer's API (RESTful interface).
    *   The API will expose endpoints for retrieving vehicle status (SOC, location, charging status), controlling vehicle functions (locking/unlocking, starting/stopping charging, pre-conditioning), and accessing maintenance/diagnostic information.
    *   Data will be exchanged using JSON format.
    *   Authentication will be via OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. Refresh tokens will be used to maintain session state.
    *   The API will support versioning using semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). The app will initially support version 1.0, and will implement a mechanism to notify the user when a new version of the API is available, prompting them to update the app if necessary. Backward compatibility will be maintained where possible.
*   **User Interfaces:**
    *   Intuitive mobile UI, with dark/light mode options.
    *   Supports both iOS and Android.
    *   The UI will adhere to platform-specific guidelines (Apple Human Interface Guidelines, Android Material Design).
    *   The UI will also support localization for English and Spanish (initially). All text elements will be stored in resource files to facilitate localization.
    *   Accessibility will be designed based on WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
*   **Hardware Interfaces:**
    *   Mobile devices running iOS or Android with network connectivity (cellular/Wi-Fi) and GPS capabilities.
    *   The app will be tested on a range of devices with varying CPU, memory, and screen sizes (see Appendix D for the device test matrix).
*   **Software Interfaces:**
    *   Integrates with mapping applications (e.g., Google Maps API, Apple Maps API) and charging network APIs (e.g., Electrify America, ChargePoint).
    *   The charging network APIs will be used to retrieve charging station availability and pricing information. The app will use a standardized interface (e.g., OCPP – Open Charge Point Protocol) where available, to ensure compatibility with a wider range of charging networks.
*   **Communication Interfaces:**
    *   HTTP/HTTPS for API communication (TLS 1.3 or higher).
    *   GPS for location tracking.
    *   Push Notifications (using FCM for Android and APNs for iOS) for alerts. Push notifications will be encrypted end-to-end to protect sensitive information.

**2.2 Product Functions**

The ECM App will provide the following major functions, prioritized from highest to lowest. *Functional groups are defined by the primary functionality they provide to the user*:

1.  **Vehicle Monitoring:** Displays real-time battery level, charging status, location, energy consumption metrics, and route history.
2.  **Charging Management:** Locates nearby charging stations, schedules charging sessions, sets charging limits, and tracks charging costs/history.
3.  **Vehicle Control:** Remotely starts/stops charging, pre-conditions cabin temperature, locks/unlocks vehicle, and activates horn/lights. *User confirmation will be required for critical operations like remotely starting/stopping charging.*
4.  **Trip Planning:** Plans routes with charging stops, calculates trip energy requirements, and saves favorite locations/routes. Adjusts range based on weather conditions.
5.  **Maintenance & Diagnostics:** Displays maintenance reminders/alerts, accesses vehicle diagnostic information, schedules service appointments, and tracks maintenance history/costs.

**2.3 User Characteristics**

The primary users of the ECM App are car engineering team members, typically with varying degrees of technical expertise. The application should be intuitive to use for both technical and non-technical users.

*   **Education Level:** High school diploma or equivalent (minimum).
*   **Experience:** Ranging from novice mobile app users to experienced automotive engineers.  *Approximately 60% of users are expected to be familiar with mobile apps.*
*   **Technical Expertise:** Varies significantly across user groups. The UI/UX should be designed to cater to the least technically savvy user (40%) while providing advanced features for experienced users (60%). UI/UX guidelines will emphasize simplicity and ease of use. The UI will provide context-sensitive help and tutorials to assist users with less technical expertise.

**2.4 Constraints**

*   **Regulatory Policies:**
    *   Complies with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    *   *Specifically, the app will implement consent management for data collection and sharing, provide users with the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data, and comply with data localization requirements where applicable. Consent will be obtained through an explicit opt-in mechanism, and users will be able to revoke consent at any time.*
    *   Data will be retained only for as long as necessary and will be anonymized where possible.
    *   Data residency will be in accordance with EU regulations.
*   **Hardware Limitations:**
    *   App must perform acceptably on a range of mobile devices (CPU, memory, screen size).
    *   *Acceptable performance is defined as a frame rate of at least 30 FPS and a memory footprint of less than 200MB on devices with at least 2GB of RAM.  Performance testing will be conducted on a representative set of devices (see Appendix D).*
*   **API Availability:**
    *   Functionality depends on the availability and reliability of the vehicle manufacturer's API.
    *   *The app will implement retry mechanisms and fallback strategies to handle API outages. A circuit breaker pattern will be implemented to prevent cascading failures. In the event of prolonged API outages, the app will display a clear error message to the user and provide information about the outage.*
*   **Security:**
    *   Vehicle control functions must be secured against unauthorized access.
    *   *The app will use TLS 1.3 or higher for secure communication, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) using TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) based on RFC 6238, and encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption. User confirmation will be required to complete the operation.*
    *   Key management will be performed using a secure key store provided by the operating system (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). Keys will be rotated regularly.
    *   The app will implement jailbreak/root detection to prevent running on compromised devices.
    *   The application will comply with OWASP Mobile Security Project guidelines.
*   **Offline Functionality:** Limited offline functionality is required (e.g., viewing saved locations/routes).
*   **Response Time:** Critical operations (e.g., remote lock/unlock, start/stop charging) should have a response time under 3 seconds.
*   **Mobile OS Versions:** Supports Android 8.0 (Oreo) and above, and iOS 13 and above.
*   **Accessibility:** The application will adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.

        *   **Verification:** Verify that the application can accurately calculate trip energy requirements based on distance, elevation, and weather conditions. Compare calculations from TP-1.1 to data reported after driving to verify that energy requirements are accurate. Accuracy of the trip energy calculation will be verified against real-world driving data, comparing the predicted energy consumption to the vehicle's actual consumption for multiple routes and weather conditions.
        *   **Trip Energy Calculation Details:**  The trip energy requirements will be calculated using the following formula: *Energy (kWh) = (Distance (km) * Base Consumption (kWh/km) * (1 + Elevation Factor + Weather Factor)).* The *Base Consumption* is a vehicle-specific parameter representing the average energy consumption under ideal conditions. The *Elevation Factor* is a percentage increase in energy consumption per meter of elevation gain.  The *Weather Factor* adjusts energy requirements based on temperature and wind.  Temperature: For every degree Celsius below 20°C, energy consumption increases by 0.5%. For every degree Celsius above 20°C, energy consumption increases by 0.25% to account for A/C use. Wind: For every 1 km/h of headwind, energy consumption increases by 0.1%.

        *   **URD Ref:** URD-8
        *   **Verification:** Verify the calculated range takes weather into account. Compare the estimated range with actual range achieved in similar weather conditions by reviewing the driving history and using the following equation: *Adjusted Range = Base Range * (1 - Temperature Impact Factor - Wind Impact Factor)* where Temperature Impact Factor is a percentage reduction per degree Celsius below 20°C, and Wind Impact Factor is a percentage reduction per km/h of headwind. For example, if the temperature is 10°C (10 degrees below 20°C), the Temperature Impact Factor may be 0.01 per degree (10% reduction). If there is a 10 km/h headwind, and the Wind Impact Factor is 0.005 (0.5% reduction per km/h), the wind factor would be 5%.
