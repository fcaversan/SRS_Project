title Home Screen Data Loading Activity Diagram (Iteration 4)
|Client App|
start
:User navigates to Home Screen;
:Show loading state (e.g., spinner);
:Request vehicle status from backend
(GET /v2/vehicle/{id}/status);

|#Technology|Backend API|
:Receive request;
:Authenticate user & identify vehicle
(with access to user preferences);
if (Authentication failed?) then (yes)
  :Return 401 Unauthorized;
  -->|Client App|
  :Display "Authentication error" message;
  stop
endif

note right: Parallel data fetching from vehicle data sources/cache
fork
  :Fetch Battery Data
  (SoC, recent consumption);
fork again
  :Fetch Environment Data
  (ambient temperature);
fork again
  :Fetch Vehicle State Data
  (lock status, cabin temp, climate active);
fork again
  :Fetch Vehicle Visual Asset URL;
end fork

:Calculate Estimated Range
(uses SoC, consumption, temp, and user's preferred unit);
note left
  Architectural Decision: Range calculation (FR-HSS-004)
  and unit preference logic is centralized on the backend
  to ensure consistency across all clients.
end note

:Determine data freshness;
:Assemble `VehicleStatusDTO`;
note on link
  DTO now includes:
  - `vehicleImageUrl: String`
  - `isStale: boolean`
  - `lastUpdated: timestamp`
end note
:Send 200 OK Response with `VehicleStatusDTO`;

|Client App|
:Receive API Response;
if (Response is 200 OK?) then (yes)
  :Hide loading state;
  :Parse `VehicleStatusDTO`;
  if (DTO indicates stale data?) then (yes)
    :Display stale data indicator
    (e.g., "Updated 2m ago" using `lastUpdated`);
  endif
  :Update View Model with DTO data;
  note right: UI components are updated in parallel from the View Model
  fork
    'Battery and Range UI
    :Display SoC & pre-calculated Range
    (FR-HSS-001, FR-HSS-003);
    :Update visual battery level

  fork again
    'Security and Climate UI
    :Display Lock, Temperature & Climate status
    (FR-HSS-005, FR-HSS-006, FR-HSS-007);
    note right: Temp is pre-formatted in user's preferred unit

  fork again

    :Load vehicle image using URL from DTO
    (FR-HSS-008);
  end fork

else (no / API error)
  :Hide loading state;
  :Display appropriate error message
  (e.g., "Could not connect to vehicle");
