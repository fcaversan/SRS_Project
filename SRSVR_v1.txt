## Electric Car Management Mobile Application SRS Validation Report

**Date:** October 27, 2023

**Version:** 1.0

**1. Executive Summary**

This report presents the findings of a validation assessment of the Electric Car Management Mobile Application Software Requirements Specification (SRS) against the provided User Requirements Document (URD) and the IEEE 830-1998 standard. The SRS demonstrates a good faith effort to address the URD and conform to IEEE 830, but it requires several improvements. Key areas of concern include missing requirements, lack of detail in certain sections, and some inconsistencies in terminology. Several requirements lacked proper definition to provide "SMART" criteria, and some requirements from the URD were missing. Following the recommendations in this report will significantly improve the quality and completeness of the SRS.

**2. Detailed Analysis by Section**

**2.1. Introduction**

*   **1.1 Purpose:** Adequate. Clearly states the purpose and intended audience.
*   **1.2 Scope:** Adequate. Specifies the software product and what it will and will not do. It also identifies the mobile platform that will be utilized by the application.
*   **1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations:** Adequate. Provides definitions of key terms. However, this section should include more terms specific to the electric vehicle domain (e.g., kW, kWh, charging connector types).
*   **1.4 References:** Adequate. Lists referenced documents.
*   **1.5 Overview:** Adequate. Describes the organization of the document.

**2.2. Overall Description**

*   **2.1 Product Perspective:** Mostly adequate. Describes the app's relationship to the vehicle and other systems. The system interfaces, user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software interfaces, and communication interfaces are all defined. However, more detail should be included about the API being used and the types of data being exchanged.
*   **2.2 Product Functions:** Adequate. Summarizes the major functions of the app. The functional requirements should be prioritized in this section.
*   **2.3 User Characteristics:** Adequate. Describes the intended users. However, the UI/UX should be designed to cater to the least technically savvy user while providing advanced features for experienced users. The requirements can include more specifics, such as the percentage of users familiar with mobile apps and the overall level of experience.
*   **2.4 Constraints:** Mostly adequate. Lists regulatory, hardware, API, security, offline functionality, and response time constraints. However, the descriptions are relatively general and high-level.
*   **2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies:** Adequate. Lists assumptions about API availability, user accounts, internet connectivity, GPS, and mapping data.

**2.3. Specific Requirements**

*   **3.1 External Interface Requirements:** Mostly adequate. The subsections API Interface, User Interface, Mapping Interface, and Notification Interface are appropriately specified.
*   **3.2 Functional Requirements:** Mostly adequate, but requires improvements for clarity, specificity and completeness. All functions from the URD are accounted for.
*   **3.3 Performance Requirements:** Adequate. The specified subsections provide performance measures such as response time, battery consumption, concurrent users, and location updates.
*   **3.4 Design Constraints:** Adequate. The specified subsections provide design constraints for the application's technology, UI/UX, security, authentication, authorization levels, and compliance with data privacy regulations.
*   **3.5 Software System Attributes:** Mostly adequate. The sections provide sufficient reliability, availability, security, maintainability, and portability requirements.
*   **3.6 Data Requirements:** Adequate. User profiles, vehicle information, charging history, and trip history are securely stored by the application. User consent is required before sharing personal data.

**2.4. Supporting Information**

*   **4.1 Appendix A: Data Dictionary:** Incomplete. Currently, it is set to TBD. The TBD must be completed with the data types and field requirements.
*   **4.2 Appendix B: Sample Input/Output Formats:** Incomplete. Currently, it is set to TBD. The TBD must be completed with the sample input/output formats and sample JSON request/response formats for API communication.
*   **4.3 Index:** Incomplete. Missing index.

**3. List of Missing Requirements**

*   **Detailed API Specifications:** While the SRS mentions the vehicle manufacturer's API, it lacks specific details about the API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms. This detail is critical for development.
*   **Error Handling and Recovery:**  The SRS mentions responses to abnormal situations in the Functional Requirements section, but it lacks specifics on error handling and recovery mechanisms for different types of errors (e.g., API errors, network errors, data validation errors).
*   **Specific Data Validation Rules:** The SRS alludes to data validation, but doesn't define the specific validation rules for different data fields (e.g., range checks, format checks, required fields).
*   **Biometric Authentication Details:** The SRS mentions biometric authentication, but it doesn't specify which biometric methods are supported (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition) or the security protocols used.

**4. Compliance Gaps with IEEE 830-1998**

*   **Completeness:** The SRS has sections marked as "TBD" (Appendix A and B). This violates the completeness characteristic of a good SRS (4.3.3).
*   **Traceability:** While IDs are given, no actual traceability matrix exists. A matrix mapping user requirements from the URD to the SRS and design documents should be created.
*   **Modifiability:** Incomplete appendixes decrease modifiability.
*   **Ranking:** Each functional/non-functional/performance requirement does not have a level of necessity and/or degree of stability.

**5. Specific Recommendations for Improvement**

1.  **Complete TBD Sections:** Fill in the "TBD" sections (Appendix A and B) with detailed information about data elements, API specifications, and sample input/output formats.
2.  **Create a Traceability Matrix:** Develop a detailed traceability matrix to map user requirements from the URD to specific software requirements in the SRS.
3.  **Elaborate on Constraints:** Provide more specific details about the constraints listed in Section 2.4. For example, specify the exact GDPR/CCPA requirements, the acceptable range of mobile device performance characteristics, and the specific security protocols used.
4.  **Specify Error Handling:** Elaborate on error handling requirements, including specific error messages, recovery procedures, and logging mechanisms.
5.  **Define Data Validation Rules:** Specify the data validation rules for each data field in the application.
6.  **Include Biometric Authentication Details:** Provide specific details about the biometric authentication methods supported and the security protocols used.
7. **Improve Testability:** Enhance verification clauses to provide more detailed instructions and measures of success.
