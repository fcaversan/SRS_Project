**1.5 Overview**

The remainder of this SRS document provides a detailed description of the ECM App, including the overall product perspective, product functions, user characteristics, constraints, assumptions, and specific requirements. Section 2 provides a general overview of the application. Section 3 provides functional, non-functional, and interface requirements in detail.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**

The ECM App will be a mobile application that interacts with the electric vehicle through a secure API provided by the vehicle manufacturer's backend system. The app will be a component of a larger ecosystem, integrating with the vehicle's onboard systems, charging station networks, and potentially other services (e.g., mapping/navigation apps).
The ECM App does not directly interact with the electric vehicle's hardware. All communication is via manufacturer API.

*   **System Interfaces:** The app will interact with the vehicle manufacturer's API (RESTful interface). The API will expose endpoints for retrieving vehicle status (SOC, location, charging status), controlling vehicle functions (locking/unlocking, starting/stopping charging, pre-conditioning), and accessing maintenance/diagnostic information.  Data will be exchanged using JSON format.  Authentication will be via OAuth 2.0.
*   **User Interfaces:** Intuitive mobile UI, with dark/light mode options. Supports both iOS and Android. The UI will adhere to platform-specific guidelines (Apple Human Interface Guidelines, Android Material Design). The UI will also support localization for English and Spanish (initially). Accessibility will be designed based on WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
*   **Hardware Interfaces:** Mobile devices running iOS or Android with network connectivity (cellular/Wi-Fi) and GPS capabilities.  The app will be tested on a range of devices with varying CPU, memory, and screen sizes.
*   **Software Interfaces:** Integrates with mapping applications (e.g., Google Maps API, Apple Maps API) and charging network APIs (e.g., Electrify America, ChargePoint). The charging network APIs will be used to retrieve charging station availability and pricing information.
*   **Communication Interfaces:**  HTTP/HTTPS for API communication, GPS for location tracking, Push Notifications (using FCM for Android and APNs for iOS) for alerts.

**2.2 Product Functions**

The ECM App will provide the following major functions, prioritized from highest to lowest:

1.  **Vehicle Monitoring:** Displays real-time battery level, charging status, location, energy consumption metrics, and route history.
2.  **Charging Management:** Locates nearby charging stations, schedules charging sessions, sets charging limits, and tracks charging costs/history.
3.  **Vehicle Control:** Remotely starts/stops charging, pre-conditions cabin temperature, locks/unlocks vehicle, and activates horn/lights. *User confirmation will be required for critical operations like remotely starting/stopping charging.*
4.  **Trip Planning:** Plans routes with charging stops, calculates trip energy requirements, and saves favorite locations/routes. Adjusts range based on weather conditions.
5.  **Maintenance & Diagnostics:** Displays maintenance reminders/alerts, accesses vehicle diagnostic information, schedules service appointments, and tracks maintenance history/costs.

**2.3 User Characteristics**

The primary users of the ECM App are car engineering team members, typically with varying degrees of technical expertise. The application should be intuitive to use for both technical and non-technical users.

*   **Education Level:** High school diploma or equivalent (minimum).
*   **Experience:** Ranging from novice mobile app users to experienced automotive engineers.  *Approximately 60% of users are expected to be familiar with mobile apps.*
*   **Technical Expertise:** Varies significantly across user groups. The UI/UX should be designed to cater to the least technically savvy user (40%) while providing advanced features for experienced users (60%). UI/UX guidelines will emphasize simplicity and ease of use.

**2.4 Constraints**

*   **Regulatory Policies:** Complies with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). *Specifically, the app will implement consent management for data collection and sharing, provide users with the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data, and comply with data localization requirements where applicable.*
*   **Hardware Limitations:** App must perform acceptably on a range of mobile devices (CPU, memory, screen size). *Acceptable performance is defined as a frame rate of at least 30 FPS and a memory footprint of less than 200MB on devices with at least 2GB of RAM.*
*   **API Availability:** Functionality depends on the availability and reliability of the vehicle manufacturer's API. *The app will implement retry mechanisms and fallback strategies to handle API outages.*
*   **Security:** Vehicle control functions must be secured against unauthorized access. *The app will use TLS 1.3 for secure communication, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), and encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption. User confirmation will be required to complete the operation.*
*   **Offline Functionality:** Limited offline functionality is required (e.g., viewing saved locations/routes).
*   **Response Time:** Critical operations (e.g., remote lock/unlock, start/stop charging) should have a response time under 3 seconds.
*   **Mobile OS Versions:** Supports Android 8.0 (Oreo) and above, and iOS 13 and above.

**2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies**

*   The vehicle manufacturer will provide a stable and well-documented API for accessing vehicle data and control functions.
*   Users will have a valid account and authorized access to the electric vehicle.
*   Internet connectivity (cellular/Wi-Fi) will be available for most functions.
*   GPS functionality will be available on the user's mobile device.
*   Mapping data will be available through third-party mapping services (e.g., Google Maps API, Apple Maps API). *The app will use the free tier of these APIs initially, with the option to upgrade to a paid plan if usage exceeds the free tier limits.*
*   Charging station data will be available through public APIs from charging network providers (e.g. Electrify America, ChargePoint).

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1.  **Addressed All Identified Issues:**  The TBD sections were completed, a sample traceability matrix (Appendix C) was created, constraints were elaborated with specific details, error handling and data validation rules were specified, and biometric authentication details were included.

2.  **Maintained Document Structure:** The IEEE 830-1998 structure was kept, sections are properly organized and numbered, and the version number was updated to reflect the revision.

3.  **Improved Requirement Quality:** Requirements were made more specific, measurable, and testable.  Missing requirement IDs and priorities were added, and traceability between user needs and software requirements was ensured. Verification clauses were improved to provide more testability and detail.
4.  **Enhanced Completeness:** Missing sections and subsections were added, detailed specifications for interfaces, performance, and constraints were added, and comprehensive error handling and security details were provided.
5. **Compliance Issues**: Resolved issues from the IEEE compliance checklist.
6. **Clarity**: Improved use of terminology and clear documentation.
7. **Added Revision History**: Added a revision history table to track changes.
8.  **Included:** All areas specified at the end of the original instructions.
